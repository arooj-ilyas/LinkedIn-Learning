_Note: At the time of this course React v18 was being used, this course has been adjusted on my end to utilize v19 to keep up to date with latest version releases whilst still learning basic React fundamentals._

### Lessons learnt:

- Hooks allow you to add state to function components and abstract logic into seperate functions
- Any hook from react has to start with prefix 'use' (e.g. useState, useReducer, useEffect)
- Good practice to use functions rather than classes when creating components (classes could be removed in later React versions)
