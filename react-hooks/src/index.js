/*
- useState expects two items in its array
  1. name of state variable we want to keep track of
  2. function to change the state of the variable 
- use useState hook to keep track of value of checkbox
- more often than not, we are not working with a single component, so working with state in a component tree is an important concept to grasp

- useEffect side effects are typically console.logs or some kind of DOM api (e.g. history or window)
- typically to use useEffect, you need to set up a state variable
- useEffect takes in a function and by default runs after each render and each update, using [] makes it run only on first render
