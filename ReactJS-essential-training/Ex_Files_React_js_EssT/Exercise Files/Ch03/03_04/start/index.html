<!-- Each child within a list should have a unique key prop; or a red console error will appear -->
<!-- This is necessary because things might get out of sync when rendering occurs, especially if something is added to front or middle of list -->
<!-- Think of a key like an ID which keeps everything in sync -->
<!-- You culd use index position as a key when mapping, but react docs advise against this as could still cause issues when rendering, aka becomes counter-intuitive -->

<!-- The recommended approach: perform a data transformation for each item in the array to be in its own object, with a corresponding id and title value -->
<!-- Whenever you return an object from an arrow function, we need to point that arrow function to a set of parenthesis rather than the direct object -->

<!-- By creating a data transformation, data is STABLE (i.e. not being key'd with index while rendering) -->
<!-- Keys help keep data in sync as your application changes over time -->
